# Vendored Payload TanStack Vite workarounds

Refreshed from `@payloadcms/tanstack-start@4.0.0-beta.2`
(`dist/withPayload/workarounds/*`, `dist/withPayload/config/{external,optimizeDeps}.js`
and `dist/withPayload/importProtection.js`) on 2026-10-18.
`clientModuleResolution.js` retains the equivalent local Bun file/path APIs.

The full adapter wrapper previously made every route return 404 on this TanStack
line. These workarounds preserve the proven plugin order and let Start own the
RSC handler (`serverHandler: false`). Keep the wrapper out until `/admin` is
verified to route correctly with it.

Refresh these files after each adapter upgrade. Remove them once the upstream
wrapper is verified against the application's boot contract.
